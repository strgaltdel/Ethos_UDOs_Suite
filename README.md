Unlike conventional widgets, they are called via a  "wrapper", so it is possible to run up to three apps simultaneously in one widget frame.



The individual apps can be selected  by touch operation.

Furthermore, each app can support multiple pages, which can also be scrolled through by touch.

The wrapper exists in several variants (1,2,3), so that a single frame, two frames, or even two frames (each with three apps) and a TopBar can be used.

Topbars can be generated individually by Lua developers, three examples are included
